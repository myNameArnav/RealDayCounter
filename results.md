## As previously thought that it would make a significant difference, but it does not

### Here is a plot to show 100000 days

## As one can see there no difference, both the lines seem overlapping.

### If we zoom into the graph, we can see that its very insignificant in the grand scheme of things.

## The difference line is also looking like its going straight up, but if we look at the list

```py
actualTime = [0.0, 24.0, 48.0, 72.0, 96.0, 120.0, 144.0, 168.0, 192.0, 216.0, 240.0, 264.0, 288.0, 312.0, 336.0, 360.0, 384.0, 408.0, 432.0, 456.0]
leapTime   = [0.0, 24.02, 48.03, 72.05, 96.07, 120.08, 144.1, 168.12, 192.13, 216.15, 240.16, 264.18, 288.2, 312.21, 336.23, 360.25, 384.26, 408.28, 432.3, 456.31]
diffrence  = [0.0, 0.02, 0.03, 0.05, 0.07, 0.08, 0.1, 0.12, 0.13, 0.15, 0.16, 0.18, 0.2, 0.21, 0.23, 0.25, 0.26, 0.28, 0.3, 0.31]
```

The diffrence is just too small for plotting on on the same chart as other two.
